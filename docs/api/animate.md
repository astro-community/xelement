# `@animate`

file changed

XElement allows you to **animate** just about *any* **element** just by passing it a set of key-frames and timing instructions.

With XElement, animations that you would normally define with CSS are instead described directly *inside any element.* XElement employs the native [`Web Animation API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) to make your HTML elements sing, dance, roll over, play dead... all sorts of crazy and wonderful things. Letting you bring your site and content to life.

XElement uses two reserved `@` methods to pass through its animation instructions: `@animate:Record<Object>` and its sister method `@timings:Object`. Both are required in order to perform a transformation, as animations are a sequence of actions over time.

The first method describes a list of actions to be performed, and the second method describes the timing at which these transformations should occur.

## How to use

### `@animate = {}`

The `@animate` method accepts a series of key-frames (animation instructions) as either as a list of objects or as a record of objects using a `transform: "{transformation}"` key/value pair. These transformation define the actions to be performed.

```astro

@animate={
    [
        //As a List
        {transform: "translateX(0)"},
        {transform: "translateX(100px)"},
    ]
    // Or
    {
        //As a Record
       {transform: "translateX(0)"},
       {
        transform: "translateX(100px)",
        offset:'0.5' // 50%
       }, 
       {transform: "translateX(200px)"}, 
    }
}
```

<details style="border: 1px dashed black; padding-left:1.5em;">
<summary><h4>Its CSS equivalent</h4></summary>
<p>
Notice that XElement, which uses the [`WebAnimationAPI`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API), requires a slightly different syntax than you may be used to when using CSS to perform your animations. (You might have noticed the `offset` property being used above, which is akin to the keyframe `step` in CSS.) Here is how the above XElement animation would be written in CSS:

```css
@keyframes moveText{
    0%{
        transform: translateX(0)
    },
    50%{
        transform: translateX(100px)
    },
    100%{
        transform: translateX(200px)
    },
}
```

</p>
</details>

### `@timings={}`

The `@timings` method accepts an object containing the timing details for the animation:

```astro
@timings={
    {
        duration: 1000, //all time is in ms
        fill:'both',
        easing:'ease-in'
    }
}
```

Within `@timings` you can specify everything regarding the timing of your animations: the length of time you want the animation to last for, its easing qualities, ... and anything else you wish to define.

-----

## Examples

Let's apply an animation to an `<h1>` element using XElement!

```astro
---
    const { H1 } = XElement

---
    <H1 
    @animate={{
        {opacity:0}, // list, in order, of transformations to be applied
        {opacity:1}
    }}
    @timings={{
        duration: 1000,  // object describing time, movement, etc. 
        fill:'forwards',
        easing:'ease-in'
    }}
    >
        Watch me fade in
    </H1>
```

By turning the opacity off and then on over a period of one second, we achieve a nice fade in for the `<h1>` Text.

All XElement animations follow this structure. But, we can do even more ...

### Multiple Animations

You can declare multiple animations that you wish to apply to your element, and even have these controlled by its parent element via boolean properties:

```astro
---
const { animate, length} = Astro.props
const animations = {
    "fadeIn":[
        {opacity:0},
        {opacity:1}
    ]
    "fadeout":[
        {opacity:1},
        {opacity:0}
    ]
}
const timeOptions = {
    "short":{ 
        duration: 1000, 
        fill:'forwards',
        easing:'ease-in'
    },
    "long":{
        duration: 3000, 
        fill:'forwards',
        easing:'ease-in'
    },
}
---
    <H1 
        @animate={animations[animate]}
        @timings={timeOptions[length]}
    >
        Have my Animation controlled externally
    <H1>
```

This method above demonstrates a heading component that has more than one animation option to choose from, depending on the specific properties passed to it.

Let's now control this 'Heading' component from a parent component:

```astro
---
import Heading from './Heading.astro'
---
    <div>
        <Heading animate="fadeIn" length="short"/>
        <Heading animate="fadeOut" length="long"/>
    <div>
```

### Organizing your Animations

There is really no limit to what you can do with the right sequence of key-frames and timing options. However in some cases it might get a bit unwieldy when you have more than a few simple animations.

Perhaps you would like to have your animations located in a separate file, filled with nothing but wonderful key-frames and timing options/

Good news! You can import scripts into your XElement component. This separation of logic between the animations and components can be then shared and (re)used interchangeably with other components:

```astro
---
    import AnimationObject from './myAnimationLibrary.js'
    import Timings from './myTimings.js'
    const {animate,length} = Astro.props
---
    <H1 
        @animate={AnimationObject[animate]}
        @timings={Timings[length]}
    >
        Have my Animations imported from another Library
    <H1>
```
