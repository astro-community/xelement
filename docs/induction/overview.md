# XElement

Welcome to the home of XElement, **Astro's first and only HTML Web Component Framework**

XElement lets you create dynamic HTML elements in Astro and enhance them with client-side interactivity (e.g. animations, transitions, event listeners) natively in an Astro page or component... All without the using one of the many JavaScript frameworks Astro supports (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Preact).

XElement takes HTML elements and makes them into interactive web components. It gives you the option to choose *when* and *how* to run your client-side interactions on a per-component basis.

Since XElement is an *enhanced* Astro Component, it has no need for any hydration or `client:*` directives. It in-fact has no renderer, instead using vanilla JS on the client to achieve our interactions.

And unlike other framework components, XElement-generated components can even contain other framework components. This allows you to combine the outputs of otherwise isolated islands of interactivity, augmenting the overall Island experience both for the client and the developer.

----------

## Getting Started

1. Add XElement to your Astro project via the terminal

```bash
npm i astro-xelement -D
```

2. Import XElement into any `.astro` file (page, layout, or component):

```astro
---
import XElement from 'astro-xelement'
---
```

That is it, you are now ready to start using XElement!
