# `@` Methods Overview

XElement provides you with nine unique methods for interacting with XElement. These are created and implemented to help you apply your client-side interactivity with little effort.

XElements methods are applied using the `@` prefix. This instructs XElement to pick up on the different attributes being passed and apply some &ldquo;XMagic&rdquo; in the background.

For each of the methods described on this page we have individual pages for each method. Giving you further insight on how and when to use these powerful features.

-----

## `@is` : HTMLElementTag || Fragment

This tells XElement what your element **is** exactly. Is it a HTML Element or a custom DOM Element?

XElement is polymorphic in its nature, meaning that there is more than one way to instruct XElement as to what it is exactly.

We explore the `@is` in more detail [here](/docs/api/methods/is).

-----

## `@do` : Callback ( element, store )

What ever you wish your XElement to *do*, it will *do* so.

```js
@do={(element,store) => {
  console.log(element,store)
}}
```

You can find out more about XElement's `@do` method [here](/docs/api/methods/do)

-----

## XElement Observer Methods

`XElement` comes with access to the three main types of `Observer API`'s that are available at your disposal. These are:

- `@resize` : [Resize Observer](/docs/api/methods/resize)
- `@observe` : [Mutation Observer](/docs/api/methods/observe)
- `@visible` : [Intersection Observer](/docs/api/methods/visible)

Each observer is setup and ready for you to provide it a callback function which executes on which ever observation you wish to conduct.

Every observer method also comes with the ability to pass through its own options. Providing an extra level of control over the observations that are occurring on the element. These `options` vary between observers and we tell you about them in more details in their respective pages.

-----

## Using Events

A Large part of XElement's product offering is that we help to make applying any event listener on any element that you wish well within reason.

```js
@click | @fullscreenchange | @mouseenter ...
```

Similar to using the XElement Observer Methods, we allow you to pass through additional options to control the behavior of the `Event`. You can add and remove event listeners, control their propagation and bubbling behavior.

For further guidance on using Events with XElement its own dedicated [API page](/docs/api/methods/event).

-----

## Animations

Animate your XElements with XElements twin API's `@animate` and `@timings`. By passing through any custom sequence of keyframes over a predefined period of time, you can make your XElement animate with very little effort.

-----

## Import

XElement allows for client-side dynamic importing of external functionality in the form of scripts. This is handled by the native `import` API.

-----

## Fetch

Similar to `import` XElement allows you to make the full use of the native `fetch` API within the scope of your callback functions.

-----

## define:vars

Have the ability to define local variables and also pass through data from Astro's front-matter into the XElement directly to operate on the client. 

-----

## Store

XElement's internal non-persistant data store. This is available to every XElement to exchange data between components.

------

_We strongly encourage you to explore each of the dedicated pages for each of the API's listed above. By being deliberately sparing here we have allowed for more space to be available to each method. This way you can have a firm and full understanding over XElement and its methods._
